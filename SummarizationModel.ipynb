    "# Summarizing Text with Amazon Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to build a model that can create relevant summaries for reviews written about fine foods sold on Amazon. This dataset contains above 500,000 reviews, and is hosted on [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)\n",
    "\n",
    "To build our model we will use a two-layered bidirectional RNN with LSTMs on the input data and two layers, each with an LSTM using bahdanau attention on the target data. [Jaemin Cho's tutorial](https://github.com/j-min/tf_tutorial_plus/tree/master/RNN_seq2seq/contrib_seq2seq) for seq2seq was really helpful to get the code in working order because this is my first project with TensorFlow 1.1; some of the functions are very different from 1.0. The architecture for this model is similar to Xin Pan's and Peter Liu's, here's their [GitHub page.](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/textsum)\n",
    "\n",
    "The sections of this project are:\n",
    "- Inspecting the Data\n",
    "- Preparing the Data\n",
    "- Building the Model\n",
    "- Training the Model\n",
    "- Making Our Own Summaries"
